\section*{Motivating Example}
Consider the following UFLIA formula:
\[
    \varphi =
    \underbrace{(f(3, a) \geq 4 + g(b))}_{\varphi_G}\,\land \,
    \underbrace{(\forall x, y. \,f(x, y) < x + g(y))}_{\varphi_1}\,\land \,
    \underbrace{(\forall x. \,g(x) = g(x + 2))}_{\varphi_2}
\]
Note that currently, the SMT solver Z3 cannot prove $\varphi$ is satisfiable.
However, we show there is an algorithmic way of proving the satisfiability
of this formula and try to identify UFLIA fragments in which this algorithm is applicable.

Let $\gmodel$ be the following partial model of the ground part $\varphi_G$:
\begin{gather*}
    a^\gmodel = 0, \\
    b^\gmodel = 1, \\
    f^\gmodel = \{(3, 0) \mapsto 4\}, \\
    g^\gmodel = \{1 \mapsto 0\}.
\end{gather*}
The definitions of $f^\gmodel, g^\gmodel$ on the rest of the domain are not interesting at this point.
Notice that because of the structure of $\varphi_2$ and the fact that $g^{\gmodel}(1) = 0$,
we can now define $g^{\gmodel}$ on all odd integers.
Specifically, we can first order the arguments of $g$ in $\varphi_2$ with $x \prec x+2$, and define
$g^\gmodel(3), g^\gmodel(5), g^\gmodel(7), \dots$ by unifying $x$ with $1, 3, 5, \dots$ and then set $x+2 \prec x$ and define
$g^\gmodel(-1), g^\gmodel(-3), g^\gmodel(-5), \dots$ by unifying $x+2$ with $1, -1, -3, \dots$ That is, we can define
$g^\gmodel(A_2)$ using $g^\gmodel(A_1)$ if we have $A_1 \prec A_2$.
This way we can expand $\gmodel$ to also be a partial model of $\varphi_2$.

Since $f^{\gmodel}(3,0) = 4$ and it must hold that $f(3,0) < 3 + g(0)$, we can set $g^{\gmodel}(0) = 2$.
Just like above, we can now define $g^{\gmodel}$ on all even integers and thus obtain a total
interpretation of $g$.
Now, for any pair $(x, y)$ of integers, we can define $f^{\gmodel}(x, y)$ to be
$x + 1$ or $x - 1$ for even or odd $y$ respectively. In the end, we can expand $\gmodel$
to a model of $\varphi$.

Observe it must be that $a \not= b$, otherwise
$f(3, a) \geq 4 \,+ \,g(b) \,\land \,f(3, a) < 3 \,+ \,g(a)$ is unsatisfiable.
Consequently, $\gmodel$ must be such that $a^{\gmodel} \not= b^{\gmodel}$.
We can check the compatibility of $\gmodel$ with the rest of the formula
after each step of our procedure and when a conflict is found,
we can learn the new ground literals from the \textsc{unsat} core and
restart the procedure with the updated ground part.

\emph{Goal}: Proving satisfiability of UFLIA formulas (or UFNIA) formulas (which may prove unsat on the way).
In the following, a formula will always refer to a UFNIA formula whose only quantifiers are universal
quantifiers over integer variables.

\emph{Idea}: View quantifiers as something that expresses infinitely many constraints on entities. The problem is that a
single entity may occur in several such constraints and we must avoid assigning different values to the very same entity.
To prove satisfiability of a formula, order these constraints and use a symbolic representation of the satisfying assignment
that assigns values to entities in such a way that following the order of constraint avoids assigning different
values to the very same entity.

\section{Definitions}

We will view quantifier-free formulas as formulas with a universal quantifier that ranges over an empty tuple of variables. Hence, quantifier-free formulas have precisely one instantiation.

\begin{definition}[entity]\label{def:entity}
    An \emph{entity} is a term of the form $f(c_1,\dots, c_k)$ where $f$ is an uninterpreted function symbols and $c_1,\dots, c_k$ are integers.\todoSR{Mikoláš used the term ``cell'', which might more succinct and descriptive.}
    \mj{Potentially change notation from $c_i$ to $n_i$ to distinguish numerals
    and constants.}
\end{definition}
Examples of entities are $c$, and $f(7)$. The term $f(c+7)$ is not an entity.

% For now, we restrict ourselves to the case where the arguments of uninterpreted function symbols may not include further uninterpreted function symbols (e.g., $\forall x\;.\; f(x+1)=f(x)+1$ is OK, but $\forall x\;.\; f(x+c)=f(x)+1$ not). As a consequence, in each instantiation, all arguments to uninterpreted function symbols evaluate to constants, and hence the instantiation constrains a fixed finite set of entities, which we call the \emph{entities of the instantiation}.

\begin{definition}[entity interpretation]
    An \emph{entity interpretation} is a \mj{(partial)} function from a set of entities to integers\mj{We do not really rely on~$\mathbb{Z}$ in the co-domain, possibly extend to sort $S$}.
\end{definition}

Given a term $t$ and an entity interpretation $I$, we can define the semantics $I(t)$ of the term under this interpretation as usual---with the difference that the result is $\bot$ if the entity interpretation does not assign a value to an entity needed for evaluating the term. For example, for $I=\{ f(0) \mapsto 7 \}$, $I(f(0))=7$, but for $I=\{ f(1) \mapsto 7 \}$, $I(f(0))=\bot$. Analogously, for a formula $\phi$, we define that $I$ satisfies $\phi$, in which case we also write $I\models \phi$.

\begin{definition}
    We say that an entity interpretation $I$ \emph{grounds}\mj{I'm not sure I like the term, because $\phi$ is already grounded. Why not ``interpret''?} a formula $\phi$ iff for all argument terms $t$ of uninterpreted function symbols in $\phi$, $I(t)\neq\bot$. For an entity interpretation $I$ grounding a formula $\phi$, we say that an entity $f(c_1,\dots, c_k)$ is an \emph{$I$-grounded entity in $\phi$} iff $\phi$ has a sub-term of the form $f(t_1,\dots, t_k)$, and $I(t_1)=c_1$, $\dots$, $I(t_k)=c_k$.
\end{definition}
For example, the interpretation $I=\{ a\mapsto 5 \}$ grounds the formula $f(a)\geq 0$, and the entity $f(5)$ is an $I$-grounded entity in $f(a)\geq 0$.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:pre-sat-cert}
    Given a formula $\phi$, we call an entity interpretation $I$ that satisfies the quantifier-free part of $\phi$ and  that grounds  all instantiations\mj{It is unclear what is  meant by ``all instantiations''?} of quantified sub-formulas of $\phi$ a \emph{pre-satisfiability certificate} of $\phi$. For any instantiation $\psi$ of a quantified sub-formula of $\phi$, we denote by $\Gamma_I(\psi)$ the resulting set of entities.
\end{definition}

For example, $I=\{ c\mapsto 5 \}$ is a pre-satisfiability certificate of $c\geq 5 \wedge \forall x \;.\; f(x+c+1)= f(x+c)+1$, and after instantiating the quantified sub-formula with $x=10$ to $\psi\equiv f(10+c+1)= f(10+c)+1$, $\Gamma_I(\psi)=\{ f(15), f(16)\}$.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:certificate}
    Given a formula $\phi$, a \emph{satisfiability certificate} is
    \begin{itemize}
        \item an order $\preceq$\footnote{We will assume this to be a well-order (i.e., a total order for which every non-empty subset has a least element), which enables induction. If we want to allow sub-formulas to be at the same place in the order, we either need to combine them into equivalence classes, or relax anti-symmetry (i.e., work with a pre-wellorder).}\mj{remove the footnote for final version, it looks like superscript} on all instantiations of quantified sub-formulas of $\phi$,
        \item a pre-satisfiability certificate $I$
        \item for every instantiation $\psi$ of a quantified sub-formula of $\phi$, a set of entities (the \emph{existential entities})\todoSR{alternative term ``propagated entities''} that are neither assigned a values by $I$, nor occur in any $\Gamma_I(\psi')$ for an instantiation $\psi'\prec\psi$\mj{I'm having trouble parsing the sentence.}

              % partitions $\Gamma_I(\psi)$ into
              %     \begin{itemize}
              %             \item entities assigned a value by $I$,
              %             \item entities not assigned a value by $I$ where $\psi$ is the first instantiation wrt. $\prec$ where the entity occurs in $\Gamma_I(\psi)$ (\emph{existential entitites}),
              %             \item entities not assigned a value by $I$ for which there is an instantiation $\psi'\prec\psi$ where the entity occurs in $\Gamma_I(\psi')$
              %                   (\emph{non-existential entities}), and
              %     \end{itemize}
        \item for each instantiation $\psi$ of a quantified sub-formula of $\phi$,
              a certificate (the \emph{satisfiability propagator}) showing that for all values of entities that are neither assigned a value by $I$ nor are existential, there exist
              values for the existential entities such that the extension of~$I$ assigning these values to $\Gamma_I(\psi)$ satisfies~$\psi$.
              \footnote{For the sake of generality, at this point we do not require the satisfiability propagator to be constructive. Below, we will then work with algorithms computing the values only required to exist, here.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Also note that for instantiations of quantified sub-formulas that only contain entities assigned a value by $I$, the satisfiability propagator only needs to certify that $I$ satisfies the respective instantiation. Hence, the entity interpretation~$I$ serving as a pre-satisfiability certificate already plays the role of the satisfiability propagator.

\begin{property}
    Every formula that has a satisfiability certificate is satisfiable.
\end{property}

\begin{proof}
    Assume a formula $\phi$ that has a satisfiability certificate.
    The corresponding pre-satisfiability certificate $I$ satisfies the quantifier free part of $\phi$. We use the principle of induction on well-orders to show that for every instantiation~$\psi$ of a quantified-subformula, the set of formulas $\{ \psi' \mid \psi'\prec \psi\}$ is satisfied by an extension of $I$.

    Let $\psi$ be an instantiation of a quantified sub-formula, and let $X$ be $\{ \psi' \mid \psi'\prec \psi\}$. We assume that $X$ is satisfiable by an extension $I_X$ of $I$, and prove that $X\cup \{ \psi\}$ is satisfiable by an extension of $I$, as well. Since the formula has a satisfiability certificate, the existential entities of $\psi$ do not occur in any element of $X$. Let $I'$ be the extension of $I_X$ that assigns to the existential entities of $\psi$ the values whose existence is  confirmed by the satisfiability propagator. Since these do not occur in $X$, for all entities occurring in $X$, the value of $I'$ is the same as the value of $I_X$. Hence $I'$ satisfies both $X$ and $\psi$, and so it satisfies $X\cup \{ \psi\}$.

    Now denote for every instantiation~$\psi$ of a quantified-subformula the entity interpretation $I$  satisfying $\psi$ as constructed in the previous paragraph by $I_{\psi}$.
    % From the well-order $\prec$ we get a corresponding well-order on these entity interpretations.
    Let $I_{\phi}$ be the entity interpretation that, for any entity $u$, assigns the value to $u$ that $I_{\psi}$ assigns to it for the smallest $\psi$ (wrt. $\prec$) that assigns a value to $u$. This smallest $\psi$ exists, since $\prec$ is a well-order. This entity interpretation $I_{\phi}$ satisfies $\phi$, and any classical interpretation compatible with the values assigned by $I_{\phi}$ satisfies $\phi$, as well.
\end{proof}

A satisfiability certificate only shows that a formula is satisfiable. It does not provide concrete values of the corresponding model of the formula. We now show how to compute such values from a given satisfiability certificate containing a pre-satisfiability certificate $I$.

For this, let $inst(u)$ either be the  instantiation $\psi$ of a quantified sub-formula with $u\in\Gamma_I(\psi)$ and where $u$ is existential, or $\bot$ if there is no such instantiation. For any instantiation $\psi$ of a quantified sub-formula with existential entities $u_1,\dots, u_s$ and non-existential entities $v_1,\dots, v_r$, the satisfiability propagator defines  functions $valprop_{u_1},\dots, valprop_{u_s}$ such that for any $\hat{v}_1,\dots,\hat{v}_r$, the entity interpretation
\[\{ v_1\mapsto \hat{v}_1,\dots,v_r\mapsto \hat{v}_1, u_1\mapsto  valprop_{u_1}(\hat{v}_1,\dots, \hat{v}_r),\dots, u_s\mapsto valprop_{u_s}(\hat{v}_1,\dots,\hat{v}_r)\} \] satisfies $\psi$. In many cases, these functions can be synthesized automatically from the corresponding quantifier elimination problem~\cite{kuncak-sttt13}.
Then, a program to compute the value $val(u)$ of a given entity $u$ looks as follows:
\begin{tabbing}\hspace*{0.4cm}\=\hspace*{0.4cm}\=\kill
    \textbf{if} $I$ assigns a value $x$ to $u$ \textbf{then} \textbf{return} $x$\\
    \textbf{if} $inst(u)=\bot$ \textbf{then} \textbf{return} 0 \`// in this case, any value (including $0$) is o.k\\
    let $v_1,\dots, v_k$ be the non-existential entities in $inst(u)$\\
    \textbf{return} $valprop(u)(val(v_1),\dots, val(v_k))$
\end{tabbing}

\begin{property}
    Let $u$ be an entity such that $inst(u)\neq\bot$. Then for any non-existential entity $v$ of $inst(u)$ with $inst(v)\neq\bot$, $inst(v)\prec inst(u)$.
\end{property}

So each recursive call of the program $val$ either results in $inst(u)$ either decreasing or being $\bot$. In the latter case, the program terminates immediately, and the former case cannot happen infinitely often, since the used order is well-founded. So we have:
\begin{property}
    The program $val$ terminates.
\end{property}

The goal is now an algorithm that computes such satisfiability certificates and a converse of the property that shows for certain classes of satisfiable  formulas this algorithm succeeds.

\section{Algorithm}\label{sec:alg}

Class of formulas:
\[ F\wedge \forall x\;.\; Q(f_1(x+c^{f_1}_1),\dots,f_1(x+c^{f_1}_{l_1}),\dots,f_r(x+c^{f_r}_1),\dots,f_r(x+c^{f_r}_{l_r})),\]
where $F$ is quantifier free, for every $i\in \{1,\dots,r\}$, the constants $c^{f_i}_{1},\dots,c^{f_i}_{l_i}$ are sorted and pairwise different integers.
\mj{Careful with terminology, for SMT people $c$ is a constant, we could use
``numeral'' for $1,2,3,\dots$.}

This does not yet address:
\begin{itemize}
    \item uninterpreted function symbols of higher arity
    \item more interesting argument terms containing uninterpreted constants or function symbols
    \item several quantified variables
    \item several quantified sub-formulas
\end{itemize}
The first item looks like a straightforward extension of the below (choose one argument to base everything on), just introducing messy notation. So we might leave it out for now. The others are interesting extensions we should think about.

% We will satisfy the universal quantifier by an inductive argument going both up and down. For making this argument work, we require that for one of the $f_1,\dots,f_r$, let us say for $f_{i^*}$, for both its highest argument $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})$ and lowest argument $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_1)$ we can always find values satisfying $Q$. More formally, there must be an $i^*\in \{1,\dots, r\}$ such that
% % \mj{Just to be clear, the requirement above does not apply to $f(x)<f(x+1)\land f(x+1)<f(x+3)$?}
% % \todoSR{Correct. It applies to both parts individually, but not to the conjunction. This is  restrictive, of course, but allowed for an easy generalization to the case of several occurrences of the same function symbol with different arguments.}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item for all values of entities\mj{I still think that the terminology is wrong. Entity is $f(1)$, not $f(x+1)$ by \cref{def:entity}.} in $Q$ except for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})$ there is a value for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})$ satisfying $Q$, and
%     \item for all values of entities in $Q$ except for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_1)$ there is a value for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_1)$ satisfying $Q$.
% \end{itemize}

% In the following, we will call this condition \req. We will assume that we have corresponding satisfiability propagators (see Definition~\ref{def:certificate})
% available.

We will satisfy the universal quantifier by an inductive argument going both up and down. For making this argument works, we require the \req condition described as follows.

\paragraph{ReqPivot Condition.}
Let $f_1, \dots, f_r$ be the functions appearing in $Q$.
We say that $Q$ satisfies the \emph{ReqPivot condition} if there exists an index $i^* \in \{1,\dots,r\}$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for all values of entities\mj{I still think that the terminology is wrong. Entity is $f(1)$, not $f(x+1)$ by \cref{def:entity}.}\todoSN{Can we use 'literals' instead?} in $Q$ except for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})$ there is a value for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})$ satisfying $Q$, and
    \item for all values of entities in $Q$ except for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_1)$ there is a value for $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_1)$ satisfying $Q$.
\end{itemize}
We will assume that we have corresponding satisfiability propagators (see Definition~\ref{def:certificate}) available.

For increasing $x$, this will propagate values to the entity $f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})$ which, since the offset $c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}$ is the biggest for $f_{i^*}$ has not been propagated a value to, before. Analogically, for decreasing $x$, it will propagate values to the entity with the smallest offset. Note that there might be weaker requirements (with fewer entities universally quantified) that also might do the job, but this needs more investigation.

In the following, $args(F, f)$ will denote the set of argument terms of $f$ in $F$.


\begin{property}
    \label{prop:cert}
    Moreover, assume a non-empty integer interval $I$ where \todoSN{Do we still need a minimum size of $I$? I think we do so as to prevent propagations overlap?} $\abs{I}\geq c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}-c_1^{f_{i^*}}$, and an entity interpretation $\alpha$ s.t.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item $\alpha\models F\wedge \bigwedge_{x\in I} Q$
        \item there is no $t\in args(F, f)$, $\max I<x$  s.t.\ $x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}=\alpha(t)$ (no entity propagated to by upward induction clashes with an argument of $f$ in $F$)
        \item there is no $t\in args(F, f)$, $x<\min I$  s.t.\ $x+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1=\alpha(t)$ (no entity propagated to by downward induction clashes with an argument of $f$ in $F$)
    \end{enumerate}
    Then the following forms a satisfiability certificate for $F\wedge \forall x \:.\: Q$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item order: $0,1,-1,2,-2\dots, I, -I,\max I+1, \max I+2, \dots, \min I-1, \min I-2,\dots$
        \item pre-satisfiability certificate: $\alpha$
        \item corresponding sets of existential entities:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item $\emptyset$, for $x\in I$,

                  \item $\{f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})\}$, for $x>\max I$, and
                  \item $\{f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1)\}$, for $x<\min I$
              \end{itemize}
        \item propagators:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item resulting from $\alpha$, for $x\in I$,
                  \item from first part of ReqPivot, for $x>\max I$, and
                  \item from second part of ReqPivot, for $x<\min I$.
              \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{property}

\begin{proof} \todoSR{I still need to check some details, e.g., the case $r<2$.}
    We verify that for each instantiation $\psi$ in the order, the existential entities are neither assigned a value by $\alpha$, nor occur in any $\Gamma_I(\psi')$ for an instantiation $\psi'\prec\psi$. Let $\Delta = c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}} - c^{f_{i^*}}_1 \geq 0$ be the minimum size of $I$.
    \begin{description}
        \item[Case $x \in I$:] The set of existential entities is empty, so the condition holds vacuously.

        \item[Case $x > \max I$:] The existential entity~$f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}})$ is neither allowed to be assigned a value by $\alpha$, nor allowed to occur in any instantiation $x'$ with $\max I<x'<x$. The former is ensured by hypothesis (\textit{ii}), the latter by the fact that $x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}$ is the highest argument of $f_{i^*}$.

        \item[Case $x < \min I$:] The existential entity~$f_{i^*}(x+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1)$, is neither allowed to be assigned a value by $\alpha$, nor allowed to occur in any instantiation~$x'$ with $\max I<x'$, nor in any $x'$ with $x<x'<\min I$. The first condition is ensured by hypothesis (\textit{iii}). The second condition follows from the fact that $x < \min I \leq \max I < x'$\todoSR{Stefan, should this not be enough? This just uses non-emptiness of $I$, but no minimal size.}\todoSN{Yes, exactly what I showed you before with my ``number line".}; hence, $x+c^{f_{i^*}}_1<x'+c^{f_{i^*}}_1$. The third condition follows from the fact that $x+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1$ is the lowest argument of $f_{i^*}$.
        % the second condition \todoSR{This is the ``glueing together'' mentioned by Mikoláš below.} is followed from the lowest argument $(\max I+1) + c^{f_{i^*}}_1 \geq (\min I+\Delta) + c^{f_{i^*}}_1 + 1=\min I+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}+1>(\min I-1)+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}\geq x+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1$,
    \end{description}
    In all cases, the existential entity is neither assigned by $\alpha$ nor appears in any earlier instantiation. The ReqPivot condition ensures the existence of suitable propagators. Therefore, the construction forms a valid satisfiability certificate as defined in Definition \ref{def:certificate}.
\end{proof}

For coming up with an algorithm, let us first simplify the two conditions: Pushing negation over quantifiers, we get:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  for all $t\in args(F, f)$, for all $x$ with $\max I<x$, $\alpha(t)<x+c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}$
    \item for all $t\in args(F, f)$, for all $x$ with $x<\min I$, $x+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1<\alpha(t)$
\end{itemize}
And eliminating the inner universal quantifier, we get
\begin{itemize}
    \item  for all $t\in args(F, f)$, $\alpha(t)<\max I + 1 +c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}$
    \item for all $t\in args(F, f)$, $\min I-1+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1<\alpha(t)$
\end{itemize}
which simplifies to
\[ \text{for all } t\in args(F, f), \min I+c^{f_{i^{*}}}_1\leq\alpha(t)\leq\max I +c^{f_{i^*}}_{l_{i^*}}.\]
Using this condition, we get a first (inefficient) algorithm for constructing a certificate. Here we use the notation that for a formula $F$, $smt(F)$ is a model of $F$, if it exists (i.e., $F$ is satisfiable), and $\bot$, otherwise
\mj{Is this condition really correct? If $F$ is empty, there's no condition on
    $I$ (it can be empty), but how are we sure that we can glue together the two functions (the negative
    and the positive)?}
\todoSR{This is indeed a problem. See my comment documenting a gap in the proof of Property~\ref{prop:cert} above.}

We are currently polishing a completeness proof for the \textsc{Sat} case. For the \textsc{Unsat} case, the essential argument seems to be the same as for Ge and de~Moura~\cite[paragraph ``compactness'']{ge-cav09}.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\phi$ be a formula of the form
    \begin{align*}
        \phi:=F\land Q\big(f_1(x+c_1^{f_1}),...,f_1(x+c_{l_1}^{f_1}),...,f_r(x+c_1^{f_r}),...,f_r(x+c_{1_r}^{f_r})\big)
    \end{align*}
    where
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $F$ is quantifier-free.
        \item For every $i\in\{1,...,r\}$, the constants $c_1^{f_i},...,c_{l_i}^{f_i}$ are sorted and pairwise different.
        \item $\phi$ is satisfiable.
        \item $\phi$ satisfies ReqPivot for a specific critical function $f_{i^*}$
    \end{enumerate}
    Then, Algorithm~\ref{alg:sr}, upon input $\phi$, will terminate and return SAT.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $\phi$ is satisfiable, there exists a model $\gmodel\vDash\phi$. From $\gmodel$, we can extract a pre-satisfiability certificate $I^*$ (Definition \ref{def:pre-sat-cert}). This $I^*$ provides concrete integer values for all ground terms in $F$ and for the entities appearing in the instantiations of the quantified formula that make $\phi$ true.
    Let $S$ be the finite set of all integer arguments for the critical function $f_{i^*}$ that appear in the ground part $F$:
    \begin{align*}
        S=\{I^*(t)\,|\,t\in\args(F,f_{i^*})\}
    \end{align*}
    Define the minimal and maximal elements of this set: $L=\min(S)$ and $U=\max(S)$. Now we define this critical interval $[K_{\text{min}},K_{\text{max}}]$ where:
    \begin{align*}
        K_{\text{min}}=L-c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}} \hspace{0.5em}\text{and}\hspace{0.5em} K_{\text{max}}=U-c_1^{f_{i^*}}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{claim}
        \label{claim:inTerminationProof}
        For the interval $[K_{\text{min}},K_{\text{max}}]$, $I^*$ satisfies the clash condition:
        \begin{align*}
            \forall t\in\args(F,f_{i^*}).K_{\text{min}}+c_1^{f_{i^*}}\leq I^*(t)\leq K_{\text{max}}+c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}
        \end{align*}
        \textit{Proof:} For any $t\in\args(F,f_{i^*})$, we have $L\leq I^*(t)\leq U$. Therefore,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $K_{\text{min}}+c_1^{f_{i^*}}=\big(L-c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}\big)+c_1^{f_{i^*}}\leq L\leq I^*(t)$ since $c_1^{f_{i^*}}\leq c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}$, and
            \item $I^*(t)\leq U\leq\big(U-c_1^{f_{i^*}}\big)+c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}=K_{\text{max}}+c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}$ since $c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}\geq c_1^{f_{i^*}}$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{claim}

    The two points above end the proof of Claim \ref{claim:inTerminationProof}. Now let $N=\max(\abs{K_{\text{min}}},\abs{K_{\text{max}}})$ and consider Algorithm \ref{alg:sr}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Line 1: initialisation.
        \item Line 2: First SMT call. This succeeds because $\phi$ is satisfiable.
        \item Loop progression: the algorithm enters the while-loop and expands symmetrically.
        \item At iteration where interval becomes $[-N,N]$:
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item Line 9. This will succeed because we can construct a mnodel as follows:
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item For $F$ and $Q(x)$ with $x\in[K_\text{min},K_{\text{max}}]$, use values from $I^*$;
                            \item use the ReqPivot propagators to extend the instantiations in $[-N,N]\setminus[K_\text{min},K_\text{max}]$)
                        \end{itemize}
                  \item Line 5: $\smt(F \wedge \bigwedge_{x=-N}^N Q \wedge C)$ where $C$ is the clash condition $\forall t\in\args(F,f_{i^*}).-N+c_1^{f_{i^*}}\leq \alpha(t)\leq N+c_{l_{i^*}}^{f_{i^*}}$. This will succeed because the model constructed above also satisfies $C$ (followed from Claim 1 and the fact that $[K_{\text{min}},K_{\text{max}}]\subseteq[-N,N]$).
                  \item $\therefore$ Algorithm \ref{alg:sr} returns SAT.\qedhere
              \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\section{Extensions}
\subsection{Conjunction}\label{sec:conj}


Suppose the following formula.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conj1}
    \forall x.\,f(x + 7) > f(x) - f(x + 3)
    \,\land \,f(x + 3) > f(x)
\end{equation}
Formula~\eqref{eq:conj1} does not satisfy the \req condition because
for values of $f(x+3)$ and $f(x)$ with $f(x+3)\leq f(x)$, it is no longer
possible to find a value of $f(x+7)$ to satisfy the formula.

Since the literals are in conjunction, for all $x$ both of them have to be satisfied. This means
the formula is equivalent to the formula where the conjunction is split into two
universally quantified formulas
\[
    \forall x. \,f(x + 7) > f(x) - f(x + 3)
    \,\land \,\forall x. \,f(x + 3) > f(x)
\]
Using substitution $y = x + 3$ we ``normalize'' the formulas as follows
\[
    \forall x. \,f(x) > f(x - 7) - f(x - 4)
    \,\land \,\forall y. \,f(y) > f(y - 3)
\]
Using the previous argument, we can merge the two universal quantifiers into a single formula
\begin{equation}\label{eq:normalized}
    \forall x. \,f(x) > f(x - 7) - f(x - 4)
    \,\land \, \,f(x) > f(x - 3)
\end{equation}
Note that the condition \emph{ReqPivot} now holds for
Formula~\eqref{eq:normalized}, so our algorithm can be applied.

In general, for a formula $\bigwedge_i F_i$, for forward propagation,
shift the  offsets so that the highest offset is $0$, i.e.\ $f(x)$ is being
propagated  forward. Analogously, for backward propagation, shift the offsets so that the
lowest offset is $0$, i.e.\  $f(x)$ is being propagated backward.

Note that shifting the arguments does not change the formula semantically.
More precisely, for a formula $F$ where $f$ is applied to arguments $t_i$,
construct a formula $F'$ where $f$ is applied to arguments $t_i+k$ for some
$k\in\mathbb{Z}$. Whenever $F$ has a model, so does $F'$; we can simply transform
any model of $F$ to a model of $F'$ by setting $f_{F'}(x) \triangleq f_{F}(x-k)$.

This approach does not generally work for disjunction, however, which
we address in the following section.


\subsection{Disjunction}\label{sec:disj}

First note that we can't in general split the formula $\forall x. \,\varphi[x] \,\lor \,\psi[x]$ into
$(\forall x. \,\varphi[x]) \,\lor (\forall x. \,\psi[x])$.

If there exists a disjunct that satisfies \req then the problem trivially reduces to the
case of a single literal by running the original algorithm on this one disjunct.

Otherwise, the \req condition is not useful in the case of disjunctions, since
assume we are propagating in the increasing direction and we have set arbitrary
values to all cells except the maximal one.

\begin{definition}[Offset Term]
    An \emph{offset term} is a term of the form $x + k$, where $x$ is a variable and $k\in\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{definition}

We are interested in formulas where only offset terms are allowed as arguments of uninterpreted
function symbols.

\begin{definition}[Maximal Offset Term]
    The \emph{maximal offset term} of an uninterpreted function symbol $f$ in a formula $\varphi$
    is the offset term $x + k$ such that $f(x + k)$ occurs in $\varphi$ and for any other offset term
    $x + k'$ occurring as an argument of $f$ in $\varphi$ we have $k' < k$.
\end{definition}
We define the \emph{minimal offset term} in an analogous way.

I use the term ``cell'' for ``entity'' here.

\begin{definition}[Maximal Cell]
	The \emph{maximal cell} of $f$ in a formula $\varphi[x \mapsto a]$ is the cell $f(t(a))$ where $t$ is the maximal
	offset term of $f$ in $\varphi$.
\end{definition}
We define the \emph{minimal cell} in an analogous way.

In our algorithm, we define the value for the maximal cell of $f_{i*}$ in the increasing
direction and for the minimal cell in the decreasing direction.
Let us for convenience define the following terminology.
\marek{In the following I still haven't thought through what exactly
$\underline{I}, \bar{I}$ are.}
\begin{definition}[Write to a Cell]
    We say a formula $\varphi[x\mapsto a]$ \emph{writes to a cell} $f(n)$ if either
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $a > \bar{I}$ and for the maximal offset term $t_{\mathit{max}}$ of $f$ in $\varphi$
              we have $t_{\mathit{max}}(a) = n$, or
        \item $a < \underline{I}$ and for the minimal offset term $t_{\mathit{min}}$ of $f$ in $\varphi$
              we have $t_{\mathit{min}}(a) = n$.
    \end{enumerate}
    In the first case we also say $\varphi[x\mapsto a]$ \emph{writes to a cell} $f(n)$
    \emph{in the increasing direction}. Analogously for the \emph{decreasing direction} in the second case.
\end{definition}

Suppose we are given the formula $\varphi = \forall x. \,\varphi_1(x) \lor \dots \lor \varphi_n(x)$.
If we can construct formulas $\mathit{pre}_1, \dots, \mathit{pre}_n$ so that
they contain only $x$ and interpreted function symbols, and in addition
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\label{pre:1} $\forall x. \,\bigvee_{i = 1}^n \mathit{pre}_i(x)$ is valid,
    \item\label{pre:2} given $a$, if $\mathit{pre}_{i_1}(a) \land \dots \land \mathit{pre}_{i_n}(a)$ holds,
	    we can apply \req condition on $\varphi_{i_1}(a)\lor \dots \lor \varphi_{i_n}(a)$, and
    \item\label{pre:3} there are no $i\not=j, x_1\not=x_2$ such that $\mathit{pre}_i(x_1) \land \mathit{pre}_j(x_2)$
          and $\varphi_i[x \mapsto x_1]$, $\varphi_j[x \mapsto x_2]$ write to the same cell in the same direction,
\end{enumerate}
then $\varphi$ is satisfiable. The argument is similar as before.\marek{I will elaborate on this later.}
However, finding such precondition formulas is a difficult synthesis problem and shall be left
as a subject of future work.

As an illustration of this approach consider the formula
\[\forall{x}. \,2*f(x + 5) = x \,\lor \,2*f(x + 1) = x + 1\]
The preconditions are $2 \mid x$ and $2 \nmid x$ for the first and second disjunct respectively.
In this case the preconditions are complementary -- for each $x$ exactly one precondition
is satisfied. At the same time the requirement~\ref{pre:3} holds here since the difference of
the offsets is even.

However, the \req condition doesn't hold for this formula. Suppose we are propagating to the right
direction and we've propagated up to an odd $x$. The condition allows us to set an arbitrary value
to $f(x+1)$. Let us set $f(x+1)$ so that
$2*f(x + 1) \not= x + 1$. To make the instance true, we need to set $f(x + 5)$ so that
$2*f(x + 5) = x$, which cannot be done.

As a negative example, consider
\[\forall{x}. \,2*f(x + 4) = x \,\lor \,2*f(x + 1) = x + 1\]
with the same preconditions as before, that is $2 \mid x$ and $2 \nmid x$.
Note that this formula doesn't satisfy the requirement~\ref{pre:3} since for $x_1=2$ and $x_2=5$
we try to write to $f(6)$ two times with different values. Furthermore, the
formula is unsatisfiable.


\subsection*{Few More Examples}

\begin{example}
    \[
        \forall{x}. \,f(x) < f(x + 1) + f(x + 2)
        \,\land \,f(x) < f(x + 1)
    \]
    ReqPivot is satisfied here. In the decreasing direction simply set $f(x+1), f(x+2)$ arbitrarily
    and set $f(x)$ as $\mathit{min}\{f(x + 1) + f(x + 2), f(x + 1)\} - 1$. In the increasing direction,
    first normalize the problem
    \[
        \forall{x}. \,f(x - 2) - f(x - 1) < f(x)
        \,\land \,f(x - 1) < f(x)
    \]
    Here we set $f(x)$ as $\mathit{max}\{f(x - 2) - f(x - 1), f(x - 1)\} + 1$.
\end{example}


\begin{example}\label{ex:ind-needed}
    \[
        \forall{x}. \,f(x) < f(x + 1) - f(x + 2)
        \,\land \,\forall{x}. \,f(x) < f(x + 1)
    \]
    Since $f$ is increasing there has to exist an $a$ for which $f(a) \geq 0$
    (this requires an inductive proof, see Section~\ref{sec:ind}).
    At the same time, $f(a) < f(a+1) - f(a+2)$ and $f(a+1) < f(a+2) - f(a+3)$. That means
    $f(a) < -f(a+3)$ but also $f(a) < f(a+3)$. Therefore, $f(a) < \text{min}\{-f(a+3), f(a+3)\}$.
    In other words $f(a) < 0$, a contradiction.

    ReqPivot is also not satisfied here. If we normalize the formulas like so
    \[
        \forall{x}. \,f(x)  < f(x - 1) - f(x - 2)
        \,\land \,f(x - 1) < f(x)
    \]
    and set $f(x - 2) > f(x - 1) > 0$, we can never find a value for $f(x)$ to satisfy the formula.
\end{example}


\section{Induction}\label{sec:ind}

In the solution of Example~\ref{ex:ind-needed}, we implicitly used the fact that the following
formula is \textsc{unsat}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ind-needed}
    \forall{x}. \,f(x)<0 \,\land \,\forall{x}. \,f(x)<f(x+1)
\end{equation}
Note that one cannot prove that by instantiating the formula.\footnote{
    In general, we could look for bounds of the form $\forall x. \,f(x) < G$ for $G$ ground.
    If from the other quantified subformulas we can derive that $f$ is strictly increasing, we can conclude
    the entire formula is \textsc{unsat} over the integers.}
Indeed, every finite set of instantiations is satisfiable.
A similar result can be found in~\cite{ge-cav09}, where from compactness we have that
the above formula has as models only non-standard models of arithmetic (e.g.\ polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$).

Using $\forall{x}. \,f(x)<f(x+1)$ we can prove by induction the lemma
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ind-needed-lemma}
    \forall{v}\exists{x}. \,f(x) \geq f(0) + v
\end{equation}
For the base case we have $\exists x. \,f(x) \geq f(0) + 0$ is valid when setting $x = 0$. For the induction step
assume for some $v$ and $x$ we have $f(x) \geq f(0) + v$. Now,
\[
    f(x) \geq f(0) + v \implies f(x) + 1 \geq f(0) + v + 1 \implies f(x+1) \geq f(0) + v + 1,
\]
where the second implication holds by the assumption that $f$ is increasing.
Instantiating the Lemma~\eqref{eq:ind-needed-lemma} by $v = -f(0)$
now proves Formula~\eqref{eq:ind-needed} is \textsc{unsat}, since we get
\[
    \forall{x}. \,f(x)<0 \land \exists{x}. \,f(x) \geq 0
\]

Another example where induction is needed is
\[
    f(0) = 0 \,\land \,f(c) = 3 \,\land \,\forall{x}. \,f(x+1) = f(x)
\]
Note that Algorithm~\ref{alg:sr} does not terminate on this example because in every $\alpha$
we can set $c$ to be outside $I$. The same goes for any instantiation method.
We can easily prove the lemma
\[
    \forall{x}. \,f(x) = 0
\]
from the first and third conjunct by induction. Again, only non-standard models of arithmetic satisfy this formula.

\section*{What Can't the Previous Work Solve?}

Here, I am considering the works~\cite{bradley-vmcai06, ge-cav09, habermehl-etaps08}.

\subsection*{Infinitely Increasing But Bounded Integer Sequence}

\[
    \forall{x}. \,f(x)<0 \,\land \,\forall{x}. \,f(x)<f(x+1)
\]

The syntax in~\cite{habermehl-etaps08} includes $\leq$ but does not include $<$. It does include negation though, but only if it
results in the quantified variables being existential. This cannot be solved by~\cite{bradley-vmcai06} (see Theorem 4 in their paper).
\textsc{Z3} cannot solve this on its own but with the addition of Lemma~\ref{eq:ind-needed-lemma} it can.
Adding the lemma also helps Vampire but not \textsc{cvc5}.

\subsection*{Two-Valued Constant Function}

\[
    f(0) = 0 \,\land \,f(c) = 3 \,\land \,\forall{x}. \,f(x+1) = f(x)
\]

In the last meeting I hand-wavedly assumed this cannot be in the fragment of~\cite{habermehl-etaps08}.
However, it is. They accept the literals $f(x) - f(x+1) \leq 0$ and $f(x+1) - f(x) \leq 0$, which in conjunction simplify
to $f(x) = f(x+1)$. They can then universally quantify this to form an array property. The other equalities can
be formed as value expressions $A \leq B \,\land \,B \leq A$. I can look more thoroughly at the paper
to see how can they solve this.
This cannot be solved by~\cite{bradley-vmcai06}, because the
third conjunct contains $x+1$ as an argument of $f$ (Theorem 4 in their paper).
\textsc{Z3} cannot solve this -- Compactness section in~\cite{ge-cav09}.

\section*{Constructing Certificates}\marek{Is this section still relevant for us?}

Very rough idea:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item solve quantifier-free part
    \item check solution against instantiations of quantified part with all entities already assigned,

However, assuming them to be non-existential allows for a uniform construction of satisfiability propagators. This ensures correctness, see the comment after the definition of satisfiability certificate.}

                  \item any order on the rest of $\forall x,y. \;f(x,y) < x + g(y)$ (i.e., (x,y) $\not=$ (3,0))
              \end{enumerate}

\begin{example}[Continued]
    Another approach in solving the problem in the previous example is the following.
    Let us assume that $f$ is a linear map. Then,
    \[f(x) + f(x+3) - f(x+2) = f(x+1)\]
    We can then rewrite the problem as
    \[f(y) < 0\]
    Here, $f$ is a so called \emph{single invocation} symbol. That means we can deskolemize $f$
    and get
    \[\exists z. \, z<0\]
    Next, we can eliminate $z$ and get the formula $-1<0$, which simplifies to $\top$.

    The original problem is thus satisfiable. What's more, the value for $z$ after
    elimination gives us a satisfying assignment to $f$:
    \[f = \{\mapsto -1\}\]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    \[f(x) + g(x-1) > x\]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item deskolemize $f \longrightarrow \exists y. \;y + g(x - 1) > x$
        \item deskolemize $g \longrightarrow \exists y, z. \;y + z > x$
        \item we have the formula $\psi = \forall x \exists y, z. \; y + z > x$
        \item eliminate $z$ from $\psi \longrightarrow \forall x \exists y. \; x - y + 1 > x - y$
        \item we get the formula $\forall x \exists y. \; 1 > 0$, which simplifies to $\top$
        \item $f$ is unconstrained and $g(x-1) = x - f(x) + 1$
        \item a possible model is then
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{gather*}
        f = \{\mapsto 0\} \\
        g = \{x \mapsto x + 2\}
    \end{gather*}
\end{example}
