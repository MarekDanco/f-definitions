# Typos and Issues in paper.tex

## Typos / Grammar

1. **Line 875** — "does not noticeably influence **on** runtime"
   Should be "does not noticeably influence runtime" (drop "on") or "does not have a noticeable influence on runtime".

2. **Line 903** — "that \textsc{sygus} approach is fast"
   Missing article: "that **the** \textsc{sygus} approach is fast".

3. **Line 1024** — `\cmpsignstrict{\coeffsign{f}}` is missing the direction sign.
   Throughout the surrounding proof (lines 1008, 1018, 1022) the macro is called as `\cmpsignstrict{\coeffsign{f}+}`. This occurrence drops the `+`.

4. **Line 964** — `$X_{inst(v)}$` appears twice without `\mathit`.
   Should be `$X_{\mathit{inst}(v)}$` to match the rest of the paper (e.g. line 962).

## Structural / Formatting Issues

5. **Line 1058** — `\section*{Proof of \cref{thm:completeness-bigvee}:}` uses `\section*` while the preceding proofs (lines 960, 968) use `\subsection*`. Inside `\appendix`, this creates a heading at the same level as "Appendix" itself, breaking the hierarchy.

7. **Line 1060** — `\begin{proof}` immediately after `\section*{Proof of ...}` will print "Proof." again, producing a redundant label. The proof of Property~\ref{prop:recmonot} (line 960) does *not* use a `proof` environment — the two styles are inconsistent.

8. **Line 958** — `\section{Appendix}` right after `\appendix` is redundant. The `\appendix` command already switches section numbering; an explicit `\section{Appendix}` produces a section titled "A Appendix".

## Wording / Clarity

9. **Line 394** — "both $\domain$ and codomain~$\codomain$" reads asymmetrically. Consider "both the domain~$\domain$ and the codomain~$\codomain$".

10. **Line 732** — "is an immediate consequence of \cref{alg:interval-check-param-withBigvee}" — the soundness of returning SAT follows from the *theorem* (\cref{thm:interval-certificate-param}), not from the algorithm itself.

11. **Line 661** — The variable $x$ serves double duty: it is the bound variable inside $Q$ and the index of the big conjunction $\bigwedge_{x \in B}$. A different index (e.g. $z$) would avoid potential confusion. (The same issue appears on lines 665, 688, 691.)

## Minor Style Notes

12. **Line 30** defines `\sygus` macro but the text often writes `SyGuS` literally (e.g. lines 213–218). Consider using the macro consistently.

13. **Line 874** — "terminates on all problems in negligible time" is informal; consider "with negligible runtime" or giving a concrete bound.
