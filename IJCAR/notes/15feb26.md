# Remaining issues in paper.tex

## Likely wrong reference
- Line 732: `is an immediate consequence of \cref{alg:interval-check-param-withBigvee}` cites the algorithm, but should probably cite `\cref{thm:interval-certificate-param}` (the soundness theorem).

## Appendix issues
- Line 942: extra closing paren: `\Gamma_{I,z'}(\phi))` → `\Gamma_{I,z'}(\phi)`
- Line 942: inconsistent formatting: `$X_{inst(v)}$` should be `$X_{\mathit{inst}(v)}$`
- Line 993: `$t'\in args(Q,f)$` should be `$t'\in args(Q,f')$` (before the proof restricts to f=f')

## Personal notes inside active `\testlength{}` (will appear in compiled PDF)
- Lines 264–271: "Limitations illustrated" paragraph contains raw meeting notes ("In the last meeting I hand-wavedly assumed...", "I can look more thoroughly at the paper to see how can they solve this.")
